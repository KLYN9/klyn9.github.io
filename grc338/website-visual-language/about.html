                        Bingsoo has been a beloved dessert in Seoul for generations, bringing families and friends together over bowls of finely shaved ice, sweet toppings, and creamy drizzles. Our journey started in the heart of Seoul, where we fell in love with the artistry of this frozen treat—how each bowl could be a perfect blend of texture, flavor, and nostalgia. Inspired by the bustling cafes and dessert spots that lined the streets of Myeongdong and Hongdae, we dreamed of sharing this experience beyond Korea.

                        That dream became a reality when we brought our passion for authentic bingsoo and Korean-style toast to Los Angeles. Nestled in the heart of Koreatown, our cafe is a place where tradition meets innovation. We use time-honored techniques while experimenting with new flavors to create something special for everyone. Whether you're here for a taste of home or trying bingsoo for the first time, we are excited to serve you a little piece of Seoul—one fluffy bite at a time. Please stop by for our specialties that balance both worlds of sweet and savory.
